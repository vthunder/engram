package ner

// Integration tests for the spaCy NER sidecar (en_core_web_sm).
// These tests require the sidecar to be running at localhost:8099.
// They are skipped automatically if the sidecar is not available.
//
// Known spaCy en_core_web_sm limitations discovered by these tests:
// - Non-Western names (Anjan, Anurag) often misclassified or missed
// - Common tech terms (CI, Stripe) may be misclassified
// - MONEY, DATE, TIME, CARDINAL etc. are excluded from HIGH_VALUE_TYPES (noise filter)
//   so money-only text like "$50,000" does not trigger entity extraction
//
// These limitations are acceptable because spaCy is only a fast pre-filter;
// Ollama handles full extraction for messages that pass the NER gate.
